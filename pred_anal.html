									<h2>Predictive Analytics</h2>
								</header>
								<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/predictive-analytics-display.png" alt="" /></a>
								<p>During my time as a Decision Analyst at ZS Associates, I led a cross functional data science and advanced analytics 
									engagement that aimed to use machine learning models to uncover key commercial insights for one of the largest
									pharmaeutical companies in the US. The follwoing 3 projects were carried out for a franchise of different brand products
									with different customer bases, behaviours and nuances. Several different relational data sources were combined
									in order to get the full picture of both the sales and marketing efforts for the product as well as a customer's
									journey with the brand.
								</p>
								<p>All of these project were created on cloud technologies like Databricks and linked to data sources hosted on AWS S3. 
									The end-to-end ML Ops pipelines were orchestrated in a way to make each project operationalized as deployable products
									that were robust and scalable in nature. The data engineering pipeline created for this set of projects was so comprehensive
									that it supported multiple other teams with data extraction and data validation.
								</p>
								<p>Most importantly, these products were continually tracked and modified by performing regular impact assessment excercises
									by using secondary data sources to make sure the results were lining up with expected business outcomes. In fact, the results
									shared here for each of these 3 projects are a result of value add analytics such as impact assessment.

												<h3>Other Engagements</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Over the years, I have partnered with many organizations in varying 
											  capacities. <br>Whether it was for my Master's Capstone Project or as a Pro-bono Consultant,
											  my goal was always to test my skills in the real-world, and at the same time
											  help businesses overcome challenges with data.</br>

											<p>For my Graduate Capstone Project I partnered with Salesforce for a 12-week project, helping them 
												reinvent the Technical Health part of their <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=000396261&type=1">Customer Success Score</a>.
												The project employed ML and Deep Learning Techniques to predict and asses customer risk based on various telemetry based signals.

											<p>A family-run manufacturing business in Seattle, Washington, I partnered with Uncle Harry's on an industry project to help them 
												be more data-driven in their decision making, specifically in marketing and sales strategies.
												I used Google Analytics and A/B tests to improve marketing ROI and also created a business health dashboard for 
												the owner to track sales trends, inventory and important marketing KPI like conversions and reach.

											<h2>Decision Analytics Associate Consultant</h2>
											<p><a href="https://www.zs.com/">ZS Associates</a>, India (Jan 2021- May 2024) </p>
											<a class="image featured"><img src="images/zs.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										</header>
										<h2>Career Growth</h2>
										<p>ZS is a leading global consulting firm with $1B+ in annual revenue, specializing in life sciences and driving impact for Fortune 500 companies with data and analytics.
											Starting as an intern, I was one of the first members of the first in-house decision science team for the client. As I began my full-time role,
											as an Associate, the 3 member team quickly grew into a much larger decision analytics function.<br> Within 2 years, I was promoted
											to the Associate Consultant role and led a cross-functional Advanced Analytics team of seven members towards the development of over 15+ AI/ML solutions.</br> 
										</p>
										<h2>Other Responsibilites</h2>
										<br>
										<h3>Innovation Champion</h3><p>I organized bi-weekly town halls to share and discuss new technologies and methods that could boost 
											output and efficiency across the broader group of teams. My goal was to break capability silos and encourage cross-team training and collaboration. 
										</br><br>With a quickly growing cross-functional space with several teams, it was hard to keep track of
										all the different innovations that were being done by members of the broader space. Although small, these innovations were impactful
										and often were things that could help other teams as well. The town hall meetings would bring all of these out in the open and give people ideas
										on how to leverage other solutions for their own problems. </br></p>
										<h3>ZS Cares Volunteer</h3>
										<p>I was also an active member of ZS's CSR effort, <a href="https://www.zs.com/life-at-zs-insights/zs-cares-day-2024"> ZS Cares</a>. 
											This is where I would come together with other members and support partnerships with numerous local non-profits to make an impactful 
											difference in the local communities. From free health camps, to pro-bono services, to literacy initiatives, working for ZS Cares was a rewarding experience.
											Volunteering was part of our commitment for social impact and being able to use our resources and expertise in analytics
											for people around us was inspiring.</p>

										<p>Aside from being my first job, ZS was also the place where I fell in love with data and 
											analytics. With every project, I grew more and more passionate about solving real-world problems
											and and the impact it had on businesses and individuals.</p>
										<p>The core values at ZS are "Doing the right thing, Getting it right and Treating people right", and
											 after 3+ years with the firm, I can confidently say that I have embodied those qualities and 
											 continue to carry them with me. I learned the value of quality and why doing accurate work is more important
											 than doing fast work. As well as, giving back and doing more for others than what is done for you.</p>

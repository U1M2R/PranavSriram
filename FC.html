									<h2>Using ML to find undiagnosed Hepatitis C cases</h2>

								<h2>Model Results</h2>
								<p>The cohort used for model development included n=295,512 patients (HCV-positive: 50,726; HCV-negative: 245,236). A total of 32 interpretable 
									clinical variables included: diagnoses such as COPD, nicotine dependence; treatments such as opiate agonists; lab tests such as AST, bilirubin; 
									demographics; and social determinants of health (e.g., socioeconomic status, access to fresh food). 
								<p>Cross-validation was done to optimize the model’s 
									precision, reduce false positive cases, and thus minimize pop-up alert fatigue. Model performance was evaluated in partnership with a health system 
									having a core focus on viral infectious disease and sufficient digital capabilities for model integration. The health system’s data cohort included 
									n=26,154 patients (HCV-positive: 4,848; HCV-negative: 21,306). The model outputs were tracked with the end users, to 
									monitor improvements in screeing-to-diagnosis ratio (SDR), user engagement, model adoption rates.
								</p></p>
								<p> 1.	Training Performance: AUROC 95%, Precision 93%</p>
								<p>	2.	Validation Performance: AUROC 86%, Precision 91%</p>
								<p> 3.	Presently 20 HCV screenings result in 1 HCV diagnosis (SDR = 20:1); using the ML model, a four-fold improvement (SDR = 5:1) was achieved.</p>							
								<p>This HCV patient identification solution was developed within the framework of Good Machine Learning Practices advocated by global regulators. 
									Post deployment, the solution was periodically monitored and tuned to manage the risks of overfitting, unintended bias, performance degradation 
									(data drift, concept drift etc.). Effective implementation of this solution can provide a resource-efficient, expedited identification of 
									undiagnosed HCV patients, thereby serving as a catalyst for universal screening guidelines and a scalable solution for achievement of global elimination goals.
